# A Python Project: Predicting the Results of a Football Game.
By {Kevin Kiprono}

# Description

In this project I will be acting as a football analyst in Mchezopesa Ltd company to :

Predict the result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (including rank of the respective team).

# Experimental Design

Experimental design taken Perform your EDA

Perform any necessary feature engineering

Check of multicollinearity

Building a model

# Approach 1: Polynomial regression model

* Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores
* Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores
# Approach 2: Logistic regression model

  - Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw 
  
Cross-validate the model

Compute RMSE

Create residual plots for the model

Assess Heteroscedasticity using Bartlett’s test

Challenge the solution.

# Setup/Installation Requirements
